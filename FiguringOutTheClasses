Color-Switch-Game classes extracts:
Main class:
Arraylist game:

Game:
  Attributes:
        private player Player; --composition
        private Gameobjects gameobjects; --composition
  Methods:
        setupGame();
        increasedifficulty();
        pausegame();
        savegame();
        newgame();
        loadgame();
        exit();

   

Player:
  Attributes:? such as ? the player list 
    private Ball ball; //knows about the ball --(association)
    private int score; //stars collected is score 
  Methods:
    getScore();   output button required on gameplay screen 
    
    
    ///and we have the interrupts, I guess part of GUI maybe?
     
    void pauseGame(); button required on gameplay screen 
          after pausing the game the ollowing should be invoked .  
    void restartGame();
    void saveGame(); # 




/// confused if to be added or not
## i dont think  costants has to be a class . 
## ball should be a class with these as attributes fixed or something
Static class Constants:
  Attributes:
    private int gravity;
  Methods:
    int getGravity();
///




class GameObjects: 
    Attributes: (creating maybe a list and then changing order or speed with which 
they appear? ) 

## maybe using random and after every shuffle increase the speed by some factor?!!!

      Arraylist<Stars> startsarraylst;
      Arraylist<ColourSwitches>colourswitches;  
      Arraylist<Obstacles>obstaclesarraylist;
     
    Methods: (guessing some method overriding maybe? Since its an infinite game no need of rendering every object I suppose)

## not clear about this part tho 
      makeAppear();   
      makeDisappear();
